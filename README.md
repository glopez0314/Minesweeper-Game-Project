# Minesweeper Class Project
    
This project is a representation of the game Minesweeper. In this game you have to navigate a grid by clicking on the boxes inside. Though beware as there are mines scattered on the board that you don’t want to click on. To help you identify where a mine might be is a number system that informs you on how many mines that box is touching. Your also given a flag button to mark where you believe or know a mine at. using these tools at your disposal, navigate the board opening all the tiles without clicking on a mine to win. Don’t worry you won’t have to click too much due to a flood system that opens up multiple boxes on the grid if they don’t touch a bomb at all.

I plan to add a function so the games timer doesn't start till the user clicks on a box. I also plan to add a difficulty selector that will change the amount of mines and spaces on the board.
